## Introduction

SPI-Test is a project developed to verify the functionality and performance of the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) on various microcontroller platforms. The code provided in this repository can be used to perform SPI communication tests, including data transmission, reception, and protocol verification.

## Features

- **SPI communication testing**: Verify the reliability and speed of SPI communication.
- **Device compatibility**: Test SPI communication with various SPI-compatible devices such as sensors, displays, and memory chips.
- **Platform compatibility**: Code examples for popular microcontroller platforms such as Arduino, AVR, STM32, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with Calculator_AVR, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
